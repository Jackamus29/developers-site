Discord has become an ever present tool for communication on the web.
We have had the fluree community on Slack for the past
several years and for the most part have been satisfied by the platform. However,
over the past year we've seen significant growth and as we've grown, we've begun
to run up against some of the short-comings of Slack as a platform for an open
community. As we imagined where we want to take the fluree community going
forward, it became harder and harder to see how we could modify our vision
to fit within the bounds of Slack. We needed a new platform for our community.
After investigating the alternatives, we found Discord to be an extremely
attractive option with all of the benefits provided by Slack and a ton of new
functionality to boot. We did some preliminary testing and found it to be even
better we than we had hoped.
So, we made the tough decision to begin to migrate our community.

## Why Migrate?

### No message limits

The primary limitation in Slack are the message limits. If you weren't aware,
Slack only allows up to 10,000 messages per workspace. There are ~700 members in
the public Fluree Slack and the amount of chat happening meant that we were only
able to see messages within about a 6-month window. As our community grows, that
window will only shrink and the knowledge shared within this space will be lost
at an accelerated pace. Discord has no message limit.

### Voice chat and screen share

Another big point of differentiation between the two platforms is the availability
of voice chat and screen sharing. Discord has a ton of features around this which
we will begin to take full advantage of. We want to enable our members to self
organize and work on things together using the Fluree Discord as needed. This
will do just that. Not to mention the functionality the Fluree team can
use to host events and activities from with Discord. (We have some fun stuff
planned for this year!)

### Open by default

Another issue with Slack for an open community is the way channels are structured.
Channels are hidden by default and require a member to be invited or actively search
for new channels to join. This is not the way Discord is set up. All channels are
public by default, which creates an easy path to exploration and cross-pollination,
with good tooling for a user to manage notifications per channel or category as desired.
We think this is better for an open community and are excited for this change in
structure.

### Better moderation tooling

Fortunately, this hasn't been an issue thus far, but moderation is a _vital_ part
of community management. Creating a safe space for all of our community members
is extremely important to the fluree team and frankly the tooling for moderation
in Slack is practically non-existent. Discord provides functionality which will enable
us to create the spaces we want and ensure a welcoming, helpful, and safe environment
for all who choose to join us.

We are extremely excited for this new chapter for the fluree community. There
will be bumps in the road as we migrate such a large community, but we are
confident this is the right choice, both for the long term health of the fluree
community and for fluree itself.
Keep an eye on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/flureepbc) in the coming weeks
for an invite link to the new Discord server. If you're in the fluree Slack, we'll
be making an annoucement there as well.
We look forward to seeing you in the new Fluree Discord!
