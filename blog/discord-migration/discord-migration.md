> Discord has better features for members and tooling for community management.  
> We believe it will be a better platform for the fluree community.

I don't think its a stretch to say that most of us are familiar with (or at least
are aware of) Discord at this point. It is becomming an ever present tool for
communication on the web. We have had the fluree community on Slack for the past
several years and for the most part have been satisfied by the platform. However,
as we've grown, we've begun to run up against some of the short-comings of
Slack as a platform for an open community. Once, we started to investigate alternatives,
we found Discord to be an extremely attractive option. We did some preliminary testing
and found it to be even better we than we had hoped. So, we decided to migrate
our community.

## Why Migrate?

### No message limits

The primary limitation in Slack are the message limits. If you weren't aware,
Slack only allows up to 10,000 messages per workspace. There are ~700 members in
the public Fluree Slack and the amount of chat happening meant that we were only
able to see messages within about a 6-month window. As our community grows, that
window will only shrink and the knowledge shared within this space will be lost
at an accelerated pace. Discord has no message limit.

### Voice chat and screen share

Another big point of differentiation between the two platforms is the availability
of voice chat and screen sharing. Discord has a ton of features around this which
we will begin to take full advantage of. We want to enable our members to self
organize and work on things together using the Fluree Discord as needed. This
will do just that. Not to mention the functionality the Fluree team can
use to host events and activities from with Discord. (We have some fun stuff
planned for this year!)

### Open by default

Another issue with Slack for an open community is the way channels are structured.
Channels are hidden by default and require a member to be invited or actively search
for new channels to join. This is not the way Discord is set up. All channels are
public by default, which creates an easy path to exploration and cross-polination,
with good tooling for a user to manage notifications per channel or category as desired.
We think this is better for an open community and are excited for this change in
structure.

### Better moderation tooling

Fortunately, this hasn't been an issue thus far, but moderation is a _vital_ part
of community management. Creating a safe space for all of our community members
is extremely important to the fluree team and frankly the tooling for moderation
in Slack is practically non-existent. Discord provides functionlity which will enable
us to create the spaces we want and ensure a welcoming, helpful, and safe environment
for all who choose to join us.

We are extremely excited for this new chapter for the fluree community. Keep an
eye on our social media or in our Slack in the coming weeks for an invite.
We are all looking forward to seeing you there!
